        <h1>A new online strategy for Netherlands’ largest broadcasting
        association</h1>
        <p>
          When BNN and VARA merged in 2014 to form the largest public broadcasting organization in the Netherlands (BNN-VARA) both the BNN and VARA brands would continue to exist and a new combined corporate story was written.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017 it was decided the BNN and VARA brands would merge into BNNVARA (notice the lack of a hyphen). Because of the corporate nature of the current brand story, a new, more fitting identity had to be created.
        </p>
        <p>
          This marked the beginning of the company's largest clean up operation ever. It also meant that, as we were going to touch all brand outings, I had the opportunity to audit the entire catalog and come up with a new digital strategy more fitting with the changing way people consume media.
        </p>

        <img class="portal-home" src="portal-home.png" alt="BNNVARA.nl Homepage design" />

        <h2>The challenge</h2>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            Take BNNVARA's mission to create positive social impact and find a way to enable the audience to ‘participate’ with the brand in an online environment
          </li>
          <li>
            Move the company into a new, more digital first direction, facilitating an easy to consume and diverse media experience while creating more brand awareness
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The team</h2>
        <p>
          This project was a huge undertaking. It was very much a multidisciplinary effort, meaning I had to collaborate intensively with several members of the marketing team, developers, product owners, product management and the head of Digital. During the buildup I worked together with our junior UX/UI designer to design the first version of bnnvara.nl, working on research and interaction design as well as mentoring in product design.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the bulk of the project we enlisted the help of a UI designer with who I worked closely together. With him focusing on UI design, I focused on  user research, design strategy, ideation, testing and iterating on the second version of bnnvara.nl.
        </p>

        <h2>The buildup</h2>
        <p>
          Within the short timeframe between the announcement of BNN and VARA being merged and the public unveiling, bnnvara.nl had to be designed and built. This called for a very pragmatic approach. Revisiting insights from research I had done previously for bnn.nl and vara.nl and verifying them with members of both associations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then did a quick analysis of the similarities to gather insights that we could use as input for writing some quick persona’s and drawing up a crude user journey. Based on this bnnvara.nl was designed, built and launched within six weeks; a valiant effort. From then on, all traffic from both bnn.nl and vara.nl would be directed to the new domain.
        </p>

        <h2>Laying a foundation</h2>
        <p>
          Now that the new website was up and running for a few months we could take some time to learn more about our audience and their experience. Not only that; this was also a great opportunity to ask about their media consumption, competitors, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          A survey was conducted among members, resulting in 755 respondents. Giving us plenty of insights to improve.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <h2>Iterate &amp; test</h2>
        <p>
          After the survey results were in we felt we needed to dive much deeper into the wants and needs of our audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I provided our junior UX designer with the survey feedback along with analytics and Hotjar data, and he set out to create a new iteration of bnnvara.nl.
        </p>
        <p>
          To test the new concept we invited 5 people in for an hour long interview and user test. A few iterations later we had a new design that could be implemented and launched a few months later.
        </p>

          <figcaption style="grid-area: c;">Some of the feedback recieved during the survey</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>A new direction</h2>
        <p>
          Due to the changing nature of the Dutch public broadcasting system, I felt that it was time to think about how BNNVARA could measure up in the digital media landscape of the future. The strategy had remained the same for years: ‘We send, you consume’.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the multitude of other media outlets popping up as well as social media taking a piece of the pie, for me there was a sense of urgency. NPO was launching a more ‘hostile’ strategy towards broadcasters’ usage of online materials, as well as the usual budget cuts. I urged our head of Digital to let me investigate a new direction.
